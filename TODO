Infrastructure:

- Add hostname settings to host_vars and related tasks
- Set timezones for all hosts (under group_vars/all)
- Add ability to create a main user on the host, and use that user for all non-root tasks (instead of assuming one has already been created)
  - Update home_automation role to use this user's UID/GID automatically
- Disable WiFi on RPi's
- Make sure primary IPv4 interface is set to start on boot
- Expose Docker daemon port to internal network for remote management?
- Add Cockpit service installation (optional, configurable)
